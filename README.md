## Galileo Provider Management

This provider management web app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and completed during what amounted to one work day. TypeScript was added to reduce runtime errors and maintain greater control over data flow between React components. (I had no prior knowledge of TypeScript, but I was able to teach myself the basics within a reasonable amount of time.) Bootstrap CSS was used for Flex, Grid, sensible design choices and responsive breakpoints.

A user can:
- Add providers to the view
- Search providers by name
- View tasks sorted in order of priority

This app is deployed at https://galileoproviders.netlify.app/.
